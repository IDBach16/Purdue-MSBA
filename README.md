Projects from Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at Purdue University. These projects have provided me with practical experience and a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. The assignments include:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Utilizing Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries, I handled large datasets, performing tasks such as data imputation, normalization, and transformation to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Implementing various visualization techniques using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn, as well as R's ggplot2, to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights from raw data.

Statistical Analysis: Conducting hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression analysis, and other statistical methods using R's robust statistical packages to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

Machine Learning: Developing predictive models using Python's Scikit-Learn and R's caret package. This includes classification, regression, clustering, and ensemble techniques, along with model evaluation and optimization.

Data Visualization and Reporting: Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Tableau, Python's Plotly, and R's Shiny to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders.
